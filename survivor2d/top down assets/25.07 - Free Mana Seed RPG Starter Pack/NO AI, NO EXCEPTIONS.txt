A lot of people download this asset without reading the user license, so I put this here to make sure you understand a very important clause!

This art is totally free, but must NOT be used alongside ANY generative AI content!

AI images? No!
AI voice acting? No!
AI music? No!
AI code? No!

Whatever new uses they come up with for AI in the future, the answer will always be no!

If you insist on using genAI anywhere in your development pipeline, I ask that you please delete these assets now.
I do not want my art to appear in any game that uses genAI in any way.

It is written in plain english, please take a moment to read over the headers at least, so there are no surprises for you later.

Thank you for your time,
Seliel the Shaper
