Each (non-animal) NPC here has a "v00" variant. Version zero zero.

Each v00 has the exact same color palette as every other v00.

This can make it easier to set up palette swaps if you plan to change your sprite colors at runtime.
Use the "bonus NPC palette reference.png" sheet to find palettes to swap out from v00.

If you're not doing it that way, then don't use v00, it's an ugly palette :-)
